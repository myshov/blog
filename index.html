            <h3>Bio</h3>

            <p>My name is Alexander Myshov. I am senior software developer from Stockholm</p>

            <p>You know it's quite cold here in winter, so instead of wondering in the snow in the nearest forest I do programming.
            I love doing it. Sometimes it is hard though, but with every solved problem I become more and more confident that I am in the right place.</p>

            <p>I've been working in this area since my graduation from university in 2008 in Bratsk city. There was a lot
            of different stuff that I did in the past years. I programmed in Delphi, C++, C#, PL/SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, Haskell and Swift.</p>

            <p>Also since 2008 I started to do yoga, and now it is the big part of my life. I passed exams for yoga teaching in 2010, but since 2013
            I've decided to fully immerse myself into software engineering.</p>

            <p>Since 2015 I've moved from Bratsk to Novosibirsk to join to the great company 2gis, where I worked as JavaScript developer.
            I worked on the highloaded isomorphic JavaScript application - <a href="https://2gis.ru">2gis.ru</a>. I also participated in the development
            of various features of the WebMaps team (2gis maps (leaflet wrapper), WebGL etc.).</p>

            <p>After more than one year I had a chance to join the biggest e-shop project in Russia <a href="https://marker.yandex.ru/">Yandex Market</a>.
            I worked there among the most intelligent programmers in my country for three and half years.</p>

            <p>Then I had an opportunity to join forces with my friend to create a startup JoysApp. I was working there as a Lead Frontend Developer,
            and it was really fun and interesting project. But unfortunately as you might know approximately 90% of startups fail and we were not an exeception.
            I still grateful for the chance and experience to work on this project though.</p>

            <p>After that I have founded <a href="https://defront.ru">defront.ru</a>. It is a small resource for developers. I also opened Patreon page that is currently inactive
            and lived for almost a year on donations from the community, giving my knowledge on almost daily basis as a payment to them. It was a super fun time
            and I was really humbled by the response that my project got. In 2021 my blog accumulated almost 2 million views.</p>

            <p>Currently I am living and working in Stockholm on a media asset management platform <a href="https://iconik.io">Iconik</a>, doing different stuff
            from architecting a no-code solution for our automation engine to tweaking animations in iOS Swift application.</p>
