            <h3>Bio</h3>

            <p>I am software developer from Russia. I currently live in the big Siberian city Novosibirsk.</p>

            <p>You know it's pretty cold here in winter, so instead of walking through big snowdrifts in the nearest forest I do programming.
            I love do it. Sometimes it is hard though, but with every solved problem I become more and more confident that I in the right place.</p>

            <p>I've been working in this area since my graduation from university in 2008 in Bratsk city. There was a lot
            different stuff that I did in these past years.
            I programmed on Delphi, C++, C#, PL/SQL, JavaScript. Some systems that was made by me still runs on one of
            the most <a href="http://www.rusal.ru/en/about/43/">biggest aluminium plant</a> in the world.</p>

            <p>Also since 2008 I started to do yoga, and now it is the big part of my life. I passed exams for yoga teaching in 2010, but since 2013
            I've decided to fully immerse into software engineering.</p>

            <p>Since 2015 I've moved from Bratsk to Novosibirsk to join to the great company 2gis, where I worked as JavaScript developer.
            I worked on the highloaded isomorphic JavaScript application - <a href="https://2gis.ru">2gis.ru</a>. I also participated in the development
            of the various features of the WebMaps team (2gis maps (leaflet wrapper), WebGL etc.).</p>

            <p>After more than one year I'was asked to join to the most biggest e-shop project in Russia Yandex.Market.
            And since then I am working at <a href="https://yandex.com/">Yandex</a> among the most intelligent programmers in my country.</p>
